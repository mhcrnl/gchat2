- Conspire is mostly dead. It's been abandoned by nenolod for xirssi.
  It is highly recommended to switch to that. jdhore may be making minor
  changes to it, but it is effectively dead.

TODO
- Implement an awaylog for storing hilighted messages.
- Separate IRC code from IRC-inspecific code.
- Python plugin.

IDEAS
- Implement a sane theme engine
- Add irssi-style tabcompletion alongside the bash-style implementation and
  provide a toggle
- Possibly implement hilight notifications through a pane above or below the
  main view so users can see why they're being hilighted even if the message
  has scrolled out of view or the user has scrolled up for whatever reason
- Rewrite hilights to be more powerful than the current implementation, with
  potential per-server/per-channel hilights support
- Get rid of all "homebrew" tree/blahblahblah shit, replace with GLib/Mowgli
  primitives where appropriate. [mostly done]
